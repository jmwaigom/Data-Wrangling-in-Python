# Albany Airbnb Data

### Project Overview

A Senior Data Analyst at Airbnb wants to conduct a performance analysis of properties in the months of July, August, September and October of 2023. 
This would require him to gather and clean a large and messy data that's located in different locations. At the moment, he is very busy working on 
another project, so he has assigned you the task to clean the data. He has provided with all the folders where the data is located. To make his job 
easier, he wants to see all the data he needs for analysis condensed in one file, transformed and ready to be used. He also wants to know if there any 
limitations that he would need to be aware of. This project was assigned to him recently, so he didn't have a chance to look at the data and figure out
what information he would want to use. At this point in time, all he knows is that he needs to analyze inventory, availability, pricing and performance
trends over the four months. He doesn't need to analyze reviews at the moment. Also, he only needs to analyze same properties over the four months. 
This means, if there are any new properties at any point within the four months, they should be ignored. This is the only guiding information he can
provide for now/ He's relying on your best judgment to anticipate the kind of data he would require to accomplish his task
