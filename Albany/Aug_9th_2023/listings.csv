We love dancing and music, but most importantly we love a peaceful home.
In my travels, especially business travel, I appreciated most my accommodations where it was clean, where I can feel as though I am home and the host took careful care to my need for peace and privacy. 
In our properties we love to give people the space to feel their privacy is considered, and enough interaction to make them feel as though they are home. We are Inn owners, therefore hosting is something we enjoy.

The principal of Philip Schuyler High was Ben Becker. He previously graduated from Philip Schuyler in 1925 and went to the Cortland State Teachers College. He began boxing at this school, and returned to Philip Schuyler as the athletic coach in 1930. He left Philip Schuyler to attend New York University, which he graduated from in 1934. In the 1950s, Becker helped to found the Big Brothers of Albany. He went on to coach boxing, as a part of the Amateur Athletic Union Adirondack District. He coached Muhammed Ali to the Olympics in 1960, perhaps why Ali visited Philip Schuyler in the later years. Becker eventually became the principal of Philip Schuyler, where he used many of his values as a boxer to teach students. The Albany Public Schools website noted, “In Ben Becker’s mind, there were no problem ","This building is located a short walk from all of Downtown Albany. Nearby you'll find famous Lark Street, Broadway Street, the MVP Center, and tons of historic buildings. The history on the street of Albany is staggeringly rich as you walk down the very streets that have seen the likes of Mohamed Ali, and Alexander Hamilton.
